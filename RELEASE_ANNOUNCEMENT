Release 3.4.1 of cpuminer-opt is available for download with support for
Windows.

cpuminer-opt now supports 38 algorithms on CPUs with at least SSE2
capabilities including Intel Core2, Nehalem and AMD equivalent. See the
performance chart below for details.

In addition 19 algorithms have optimizations to take advantage of
CPUs with AES_NI for even greater performance, including the Intel
Westbridge and newer and AMD equivalent. See the performance
comparison below.

New in 3.4.1

- big AVX2 optmizations for lyra2 +35%, lyra2v2 +11%, AVX also faster
- fixed hmq1725

Users with non-SSE2 CPUs or who want to mine algos not supported by
cpuminer-opt may find cpuminer-multi by TPruvot useful.

The performance chart below is for an Intel i7-6700K @ 4 GHz, 16 GB mem.

Normalization rates have been added to the chart to help with profit
switching pools. Reference algo x11 = 1.

Due to the peculiarities of some algorithms their performance on other CPU
architectures may not scale equally. Their normalizations rates will also
differ from those listed below. YMMV.

Normalized profitability = algo profitability * norm rate

Footnotes:
(1) SSE2 rates are simulated in software (-march=core2) on an i7.
(2) Benchmark tested only
(3) CPU architecture not supported for algo. It won't work.
(4) AES_NI Optimization not available for CPU artchitecture. Uses SSE2, slower.
(5) Normalised profitability = algo profitability * norm rate, x11 = 1
(6) Not supported on Windows
